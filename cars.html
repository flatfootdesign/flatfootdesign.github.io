							<p>
								Cars.com is one of the largest digital marketplaces for connecting consumers with auto dealers in their area. Users can research, search, and review different vehicles near them and reach out to dealers to view the vehicle IRL.
								Cars.com came to Eight Bit to help them create the first iteration of their mobile consumer-to-consumer marketplace for selling vehicles on mobile. This allows any user of Cars.com to sell their vehicle to any other user (or auto dealer)
								on the app or website.
							</p>
							<p>
								When I joined the mobile team, the first web iteration of the consumer-to-consumer selling experience had just released, but there was little planning for how this feature would translate to mobile apps. 
								My role on the team was to stabilize our workflow by creating a design delivery process and method of prioritizing needs from the organization. Once that was established, 
								I designed the mobile version of this feature with major IA and interaction improvements that made their way back into the web version of the feature. I collaborated with various stakeholders throughout the process
								such as developers, product managers, web designers, and SMEs to optimize and iterate on the experience.

								<h3>ðŸŽ‰ Outcomes & Impact</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Consistent design process led to a more predictable design cadence and delivery timeline.</li>
									<li>Participated in design critiques and challenged assumptions and conventions on the design team.</li>
									<li>Became a resource for mobile app design on the design team answering questions and teaching best practices.</li>
									<li>Unfortunately, the feature was under development when I rolled off the project so I have yet to see what the business impact of this feature is.</li>

								<strong>Initial feature landing.</strong> The experience is largely a form, so we focused on how we can make it easier and faster to complete. We implemented features like auto-complete, input suggestions, progressive disclosure, and a vehicle lookup.
								We also wanted to make sure that the flow felt natural and that information was group and structured in a logical way.
							</p>

							<span class="image main portfolio"><img src="images/cars_02.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p class="ImgCaption">
								<strong> upload and capture.</strong> This feature-set changed over time due to scope and resource availability. There are multiple functions embedded in this part of the experience and we tested for affordance clarity, ease-of-use, and 
								clarity.

								<strong>Price setting and reviewing the listing.</strong> Early versions of the review listing screen (middle) was more of a summary style view. I pushed this design to closely mimic the typical vehicle listing on the Cars.com app. 
								By leaning into design patterns users have seen throughout the site, we could cut down on time to learn the feature and reduce cognitive load.

							<p class="ImgCaption">
								<strong>Updated profile and vehicle listings page.</strong> I redesigned the user profile to be a better container of their activity and interactions. 
								I also created the view for user-created listings where users could edit, update, and publish their listings.
