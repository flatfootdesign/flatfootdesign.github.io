							<p>Cars.com is one of the largest digital marketplaces that connects consumers with auto dealers in their area.
								Cars.com came to Eight Bit to help them create the first iteration of their mobile consumer-to-consumer marketplace for selling vehicles on mobile.
								
							</p>
							<p>The Carscom mobile team was a very small team trying to keep pace with their web counterparts. When I joined the web team, they had just delivered the first iteration of the consumer-to-consumer selling experience but, it 
								wasn't considered how the experience would translate to mobile. My work on the team was to stabilize things by creating a consistent design delivery process and prioritize needs from the organization. Once that was established, 
								I designed the mobile version of this feature with IA and interaction improvements that made their way back into the web version of the feature.

Our goal was to help our customers find the perfect seat and tried to put these features easily within reach. We iterated on these features over multiple design sprints.</p>
