							<p>Vivid Seats is an online ticket marketplace where customers can sell and purchase tickets to a wide variety of events.
								Vivid Seats came to Eight Bit looking to redesign the mobile app UI and create a design system.
							</p>
							<p>The previous app had a simple and utilitarian aesthetic and Vivid Seats was hoping to inject a bit more energy into the look and feel. That being said, this project was more than adding a new coat of paint as we redesigned and optimized interactions and user flows.
								I played a key role in the entire process from initial concept pitch, project planning, workshop facilitation, user research, design, prototyping, and client presentation.
